# ANGC PACE OF PLAY POLICY

The purpose of the policy is to encourage players to eliminate slow play and complete their round in a timely manner.
For some time Members and the Committee have been concerned about the pace of both Competitive and General play at the Club.
Slow play can detract from the enjoyment of golf for many players at any level.  Few golfers are heard to complain about play being too quick!

The responsibility falls on both the Club and Players to make sure a sensible pace of play is achieved.
All players should take the time to visit the R&A website and view the pace of play manual with particular attention given to the player behaviour section. You should also be aware Ready Golf is in operation.

## Pace of Play Guidelines
These guidelines are to remind every player what they can do to reduce their round time, which in essence are:
* 3 hours 40 minutes is the maximum target for competitive 3-ball play.
* If you keep up with the game in front, you cannot be accused of slow play.
* Be ready to play your shot / putt.  While exercising due consideration for other players in your group, put your glove on, check your yardage, pick your club or line up your putt while others are playing.
* When approaching the green, speed up your exit by positioning your bags on the way to the next tee.
* Move off the putting green as soon as your group has putted out; mark the scorecard at or on the way to the next tee box.
* Always play a provisional ball if you believe your ball may be lost outside of a penalty area or out of bounds.
* Once it is clear that a ball cannot be easily found, call the next group through; do not wait 3 minutes.
* Be aware of your position with regard to the group in front and keep up with that group.
* If you feel that your group is losing ground, tell the other players in your group and try to catch up.
* If you lose ground and are delaying the group behind, or if there is no group in front and you are delaying the group behind, invite the group behind to play through.

## Ready Golf Guidelines
* Hitting a shot when safe to do so if a player farther away faces a challenging shot and is taking time to assess their options.
* Shorter hitters playing first from the tee or fairway if longer hitters have to wait.
* Hitting a tee shot if the person with the honour is delayed in being ready to play.
* Hitting a shot before helping someone to look for a lost ball.
* Putting out even if it means standing close to someone's line.
* Hitting a shot if a person who has just played from a greenside bunker is still farthest from the hole but is delayed due to raking the bunker
* When a player’s ball has gone over the back of a green, any player closer to the hole but chipping from the front of the green should play while the other player is having to walk to their ball and assess their shot
* Marking scores upon immediate arrival at the next tee, except that the first player to tee off marks their card immediately after teeing off
