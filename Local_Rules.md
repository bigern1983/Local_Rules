# Special Relief Procedures
### Preferred Lies  
When a player's ball lies in the fairway of the hole being played, the player may take free relief once by lifting, cleaning if required and placing the original ball or another ball in and playing it from this relief area:  

* **Reference Point**: 
  - Spot of the original ball.
* **Size of Relief Area Measured from Reference Point**:
  - Within a grip length of the reference point.
* **Limits on Location of Relief Area**:
  - Must not be nearer the hole than the reference point.
  - Must not improve the line of play or swing path.
  
In proceeding under this Local Rule, the player must choose a spot to place the ball and use the procedures for replacing a ball under [Rules 14.2b(2)](https://www.randa.org/en/rog/2019/rules/the-rules-of-golf/rule-14#14-2b) and [14.2e](https://www.randa.org/en/rog/2019/rules/the-rules-of-golf/rule-14#14-2e).

### Astroturf
When a player's ball lies in the fairway of the hole being played, the player may elect to place their ball onto an Astroturf or artificial turf mat in accordance with the following procedures.

* The mat is to placed directly behind the ball. 
* The ball is to be lifted, cleaned if necessary and placed on the mat at least 5 cm from the mat's rear edge.  

A ball that moves whilst on the mat the ball is to replaced without penalty regardless of whether it was caused to move by the player or natural forces.  
A ball that repeatedly rolls off the mat should be replaced in its original position from where the Preferred Lies Local Rule may be applied.

* The mat must be circular.
* The mat must have a diameter of at least 20cm.

## Penalty Areas
When a player's ball is in a penalty area, including when it is known or virtually certain to be in a penalty area even though not found, the player may take relief using one of the options under [Rule 17.1d]

Or, when the ball last crossed the edge of the red penalty area running behind the 9th/18th green, as an extra relief option adding one penalty stroke, the player may drop the original ball or another ball on the opposite side of the penalty area:

* **Reference Point**: 
   - The estimated point on the opposite edge of the penalty area that is the same distance from the hole as the estimated point where the original ball last crossed the edge of the red penalty area.
* **Size of Relief Area Measured from Reference Point**: 
  - Two club-lengths, but with these limits:
* **Limits on Location of Relief Area**:
  - Must not be nearer the hole than the reference point, and
  - May be in any area of the course except the same penalty area, but
  - If more than one area of the course is located within two club-lengths of the reference point, the ball must come to rest in the relief area in the same area of the course that the ball first touches when dropped in the relief area.

## Putting Greens
The artificial greens should be treated in the same way as conventional turf greens. 

When the ball lies on the green, if a player’s putting stroke is impeded, relief may be taken by marking and moving the ball to the nearest point of relief. This point of relief must not be closer to the hole. If no such relief on the putting surface is available the player may take back-on-the-line relief off the green.

When the ball lies on the green, if a player’s line of putt is obstructed by an out of use hole location, relief may be taken by marking and moving the ball to the nearest point of relief. This point of relief must not be closer to the hole.

* Piles of sand.
* Piles of rock.
* Piles of stones. 
* Concrete or man made foundations.
